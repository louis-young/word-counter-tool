# Word Counter

React application to count characters and words for SEO.

![Word Counter](documentation/word-counter.jpg)

## Description

This is an application which counts the amount of characters and words within the given content, and provides visual progress indicators showing how close the content is to the recommended length of a specific piece of META data.

## Motivation

I built this application as some team members at work were struggling to efficiently write META data for website SEO. This application solved that problem by providing a quick and intuitive way to do it.

### Available Scripts

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
